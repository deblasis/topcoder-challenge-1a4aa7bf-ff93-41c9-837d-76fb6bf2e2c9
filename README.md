## IMPORTANT ZeroMq deprecation!

I had to patch the referenced  https://github.com/edgexfoundry/go-mod-messaging library because it uses a library that made me lose a whole day while trying to make it work in my environment. It will be soon deprecated as stated here https://github.com/edgexfoundry/go-mod-messaging/issues/73

Also, we use Redis, not zeromq so it‚Äôs totally fine

Currently my patched version is referenced with a go mod replace entry

## WSL2 GUI

In order to run the Linux version on WSL you need an X11 server like **VcXsrv** launched with the following settings:

And then run the following command, at least this is what I had to do on my machine üòâ

```bash
export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2; exit;}'):0.0
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0
```


## docker-compose

The docker compose includes the UI which is accessible here:

http://localhost:4000/#/dashboard

you can try to increase/decrease the amount of events being produced by changing the settings in here: http://localhost:4000/#/metadata/device-center/device-list


Or going directly into one of the devices' settings:
http://localhost:4000/#/metadata/device-center/edit-device?deviceName=Random-Float-Device
